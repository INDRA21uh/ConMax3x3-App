A GUI application for calculating evaluation metrics based on a 3x3 confusion matrix

This application is designed to facilitate the evaluation of classification results into three categories, such as forecasts of light, moderate, and heavy rainfall. By entering observation and prediction data into a 3x3 table, users can:

* Calculate the Peirce Skill Score (PSS) and estimated PSS (ePSS)
* Generate 2x2 confusion matrices for each category
* Display evaluation metrics such as: TS, Theta, Bias, FAR, Hit Rate, False Alarm Rate, etc.
* Obtain results instantly and formatted in the output panel

This application is highly useful for analyzing the performance of weather classification models, processing meteorological data, and serving as an educational tool.
